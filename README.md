# MNIST_Digits_Recognition
Implemented a deep neural network model, more specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for a multi-label classification task. Given an MNIST dataset consisting of images which contain between 1 to 5 handwritten digits, the model was trained using automatic differentiation to recognize the depicted digits. The model yielded an accuracy of approximately 99.62%
